# Guaranteed Tier System

## Overview
The rune system now uses **GUARANTEED TIERS** based on your XP amount. When you roll at a rune table:
1. The system checks your total XP
2. You receive the **HIGHEST tier you can afford**
3. A random XP cost (between min/max) is deducted from that tier

**This is NOT random!** More XP = Better guaranteed tier, always.

## XP Thresholds (Guaranteed Tiers)

| Your XP | Guaranteed Tier | XP Cost Range | Approximate Levels |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1,000+ | **Common** | 1,000-2,000 | ~7-14 levels |
| 3,000+ | **Uncommon** | 3,000-5,000 | ~21-27 levels |
| 7,000+ | **Rare** | 7,000-10,000 | ~39-47 levels |
| 15,000+ | **Epic** | 15,000-25,000 | ~69-94 levels |
| 50,000+ | **Legendary** | 50,000-75,000 | ~150-210 levels |
| 100,000+ | **Special** | 100,000-150,000 | ~280-390 levels |
| 250,000+ | **Very Special** | 250,000-500,000 | ~470-700 levels |

## How It Works

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Player has 1,500 XP**:
   - Affordable tier: Common (needs 1,000+)
   - Receives: Common rune
   - Cost: Random between 1,000-2,000 XP
   - Result: **Guaranteed Common rune**

2. **Player has 60,000 XP**:
   - Affordable tier: Legendary (needs 50,000+)
   - Receives: Legendary rune
   - Cost: Random between 50,000-75,000 XP
   - Result: **Guaranteed Legendary rune**

3. **Player has 500,000 XP**:
   - Affordable tier: Very Special (needs 250,000+)
   - Receives: Very Special rune
   - Cost: Random between 250,000-500,000 XP
   - Result: **Guaranteed Very Special rune**

## Progression Design
- **Start**: With 1,000 XP, you get Common runes
- **Early Game**: Save up 3,000 XP for Uncommon
- **Mid Game**: 15,000 XP unlocks Epic tier
- **Late Game**: 50,000 XP guarantees Legendary
- **End Game**: 250,000+ XP gives the ultimate Very Special tier

**No RNG frustration!** Your XP directly determines your reward tier.
